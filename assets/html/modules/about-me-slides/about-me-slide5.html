        I am a clear communicator, project manager and a leader, who can think 'outside the box' and adapt to complex environments. Much of my time is spent researching and following contemporary changes in the management of pressing political, environmental and corporate responsibility challenges.

        Outside my work I have developed a strong interest in ballroom dancing. I started to dance at the age of 4. As a result of my consistent dedication and hard work I became Champion of the Crimea in Latin American Dancing. I also developed a passion for theatre, opera and the arts. London, of course, presents a fantastic opportunity to experience these things and is also a very exciting place to live.
