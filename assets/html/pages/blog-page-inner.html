            <p class="article-inner__text article-inner__text--bold">On December 19th I attended an interesting lecture
              about meteorites delivered by a lecturer and a former Royal Navy Pilot, David Bryant. Below you can see
              the synopsis of it:</p>
            <ul class="article-inner__list">
              <li class="article-inner__list-item">People lived much closer to nature and the fall of meteorites must
                have been a spectacular event</li>
              <li class="article-inner__list-item">Meteorites were considered sacred and special objects and they were a
                sign of great events to come</li>
              <li class="article-inner__list-item">The largest meteorite known to have fallen in the UK weighed 93kg
              </li>
